# ML-Homeworks

This is the repository containing the two homeworks done during Machine Learning course held the first semester 
of accademic year 2017/2018.

- *Homework_1* is about applying machine learning techniques to detect malwares in Androig environment. In particular,
  the goal of the homework is using supervised learning dealing with **malware detection** problem. 
  The dataset used for the experiments is the [DREBIN](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/) dataset.
  - *Applying machine learning to malware analysis- Android malware detection.pdf* is the report containg 
    every kind of information about the homework;
  - *hw1_classification.py* is a Python file which implements the entire homework. Each function implements 
    a small portion of the final result.
